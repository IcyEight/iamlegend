This project is done as a school project. The website is based on novel I am Legend. This is an adaptive creation to that novel and represents a blog RobertNeville himself regularly would have maintained if he were to blog.

I am Mahmuda Liza and am currently interning as a Software Engineer at SAP.

After coming to USA on tenth grade, I have joined Robotics club and won competitions such as SeaPerch, FirstTech and Lego Mindstorm. Now I am a pre-junior at Drexel University majoring in computer science. I worked as Software Engineer at FSS. My goal is to become a skilled and intelligent computer programmer. What I love is innovating and making people happy!
