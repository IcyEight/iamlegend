						<h2>Since <span class="purple"><em>January 1976</em></span> still the only human on earth . . .</h2>
						<p>
							I am <strong> Robert Neville </strong> who is one of the rare survivors <i>I really hope</i> of
							a plague that has converted the rest of humanity to vampires. My wife and my only
							daughter have died of this disease. I haven't seen one of my kind for years. I live in Los Angeles and am researchinging the cure for this disease. If you are out there, please reach out!

						<h1>The Disease</h1>
						<div class="content">
							<p>
								There has been a pandemic whose symptoms resemble vampirism. It is said that the pandemic was caused by a war, and that it was spread by dust storms in the cities and an explosion in the mosquito population. For some reason, although I have a possible explanation to that, I am immune to the disease. This disease claimed my wife and daughter and I was forced to kill my wife after she rose from the dead as a vampire and attacked me.
							</p>
							<p>
								After going through severe depression and alcoholism, I have decided to figure out the scientific cause of this pandemic. I have gathered books and other research materials from library, and through painstaking research discovered the root of this disease. And that root cause is a strain of bacteria which is capable of infecting both deceased and living hosts. 
							</p>
							<p>
								I also found out that the vampires are affected by the garlic, mirrors, and crosses because of "hysterical blindness", the result of previous psychological conditioning of the infected. Driven insane by the disease, the infected now react as they believe they should when confronted with these items. Even then, their reaction is constrained to the beliefs of the particular person; for example, a Christian vampire would fear the cross, but a Jewish vampire would not.
							</p>
							<p>
								Knowing the minute details helped me figure out efficient ways to destroy few vampires and infected folks here and there. But it is depressing that no other <i>humans</i> I have seen so far is uninfected.
							</p>
							<p>
								The struggle to fight against these beasts is not doable single handily. Everyday I hope for a better day..

						<h1>My Defense </h1>
						<div>
							<p>
							  I have survived by barricading myself by sunset inside my house. I was further protected by garlic, mirrors, and crucifixes. Swarms of vampires, led by one of my neighbors, Ben Cortman, regularly surrounded my house, trying to find ways to get inside. 
							</p>
							<p>
							  During the day, I scavenge for supplies and search out the inactive vampires, driving stakes into their hearts to kill them.  
							</p>
							<p>
							  I also discovered more efficient means of killing the vampires, other than just driving a stake into their hearts. And that includes exposing them to direct sunlight (which kills the bacteria) or inflicting deep wounds on their bodies so that the bacteria switch from being anaerobic symbionts to aerobic parasites, rapidly consuming their hosts when exposed to air. My nightly visitors have diminished significantly as I could not but kill so many of the vampires.

								Throughout the past years, I got so desperate for someone to have company with. I drowned myself on whiskey, drank till I could not take it any more. I was so ready to die. Then one day, something happened. I stumbled out onto the porch to see if the world was still there. And I discovered a dog! A dog was roving about on my lawn.
							</p>
							<p>
								The second it heard me open the front door, it stopped snuffling over the grass, its head jerked up in sudden fright, and it bounded off to the side with a twitch of scrawny limbs. For a moment I was so shocked that I couldn’t move. I stood there staring at the dog, which was limping quickly across the street, its ropelike tail pulled between its legs.
							</p>
							<p>
								It was alive! In the daytime! I lurched forward with a dull cry and almost pitched on my face on the lawn. My legs pistoned, arms flailed for balance. Then I caught myself and started running after the dog. And no wonder, it disappeared.
							</p>
							<p>
								For an hour I wandered around the neighborhood on trembling legs, searching vainly, calling out every few moments. In the afternoon I searched again. For two blocks in each direction from my house. I searched each yard, each street, each individual house but found nothing.
							</p>
							<img src="img/mdog2.jpg" data-original="img/mdog2.jpg" alt="Dog in car" />
							<p>
								When I got home, about five, I put out a bowl of milk and a piece of hamburger with a ring of garlic bulbs around it, hoping the vampires wouldn’t touch it.
							</p>
							<p>
								But later it came to me that the dog must be afflicted too, and the garlic would keep it away also. I couldn’t understand that. If the dog had the germ, how could it roam outdoors during the daylight hours?
							</p>
							<p>
								Next morning I went outside and found that the milk and hamburger were gone! The dog must have come after dawn, when the streets were safe. It must have evolved a system to have lived so long.
							</p>
							<p>
								The dog must have been very hungry. And that means, if I give food and not chase after him scaring him right away, there is a chance I can win him over. So that's what I did.
							</p>
							<img src="img/mdog3.jpg" data-original="img/mdog3.jpg" alt="Dog sick" />
							<p>
								I gave food every afternoon, as it used to come around 4.  After trying to track where it goes, I found out its survival technique. The dog digs a grave for itself and hide there during nighttime so vampires don't attack it. The dog
								was infected but was not dead nor a vampires. 
							</p>
							<p>
								On first few days, I tried to hide from it, then gradually I started sitting outside when he eats. But I could not move or make any sound at all. Few weeks go by, and I tried to make the distance a little closer at a time. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Then one day it does not come.
