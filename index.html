							a Gama Ray disease that has converted the rest of humanity to vampires. My wife and my only

						<h1>Apocalypse</h1>
						<div class="content">
							<p>
								At year 2009, there has been a major war between Tibet and their host country China. As oppressed, Tibetans revolted against Chinese government and demanded to become free from the forty years of repression and slavery. United States and United Nations were on the side of Tibetans. Main allies to China in this war was Russia and Japan. After five months of fight, Tibet finally became free.
							</p>
							<p>
								But the aftermath of war was even hazardous. Chinese government knowing that they will lose the war, started mass producing electronic devices that emit infrared light which causes human brain to dehydrate and lose thinking capability. As Tibetans depended on technology to China, most consumers heavily bought and used electronic devices from within China even during the war. Tibetans did not foresee the attack coming from this aspect. But what Chinese government did not know was that this light that initially started as infrared, due to physical intricacy of device, got converted to gamma ray after a massive use. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Lots of laptop users on Tibet became victim of this gamma ray attack and started showing abnormal behavior including fatal brain damage. While the cause is still unknown to the rest of the world, China found a potential power on this and started exporting them to other countries as well. This created a massive gamma ray pollution.
							</p>
							<p>
								After three weeks, the news became more troublesome which surprised even the Chinese government. It turned out that people dying from this gamma ray infection started emitting the same hazardous ray even after their death. And that started affecting the living people. Even worse, the disease caused affected ones to become thirsty for human brains, and that eventually caused the dead ones to resurrect back to quest for fresh human brains. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Story continues from here. The end result being, within one year over 120 countries got affected by this gamma ray disease and nearly 6 billion people died. About a billion zombies left roaring the world and nobody knows how many survivors were left.

						<h1>Why Me</h1>
						<div>
							<p>
							  After the Gama Ray disease swiped generations of human beings and turned them into aggressive brain eaters and even more dangerously living dead, I somehow managed to survive this incident. 
							</p>
							<p>
							  I was a United State soldier and fought against China during the attack. But I got severely hit by an opponent’s bullet on my right arm. My team was concerned of losing me, so they suggested to sent me back to US and oversee the US-Tibet communication during the war.   
							</p>
							<p>
							 This happened fortunately right before this Gamma Ray attack. While in US, I was notified of daily happenings in Tibet. Now it was too late as US also got affected by this attack.
							</p>
							<p>
							  I managed to survive while even the rest of  my family members had to accept death.
							</p>
							<p>
							  Later, it turned out that, what helped  me survive this disaster was  my early built immunity toward lightwaves. In  my twenties, I worked on a computer firm and soldered iron and chips to build and assemble monitor screen for computers. I worked on that firm for ten years and that exposure to heavy lightwaves worked on my favor during this apocalypse.
							</p>
							<p>
							  But the question may arise, how come others like me did not survive? It’s because the firm I worked on was located on China, the same company who helped Chinese government built the new infrared laptops. I am assuming not a lot of people got the chance to work for so long and work on the front-end technology of monitor display. But there is still chance that someone is alive out there.

						<h1>Dog</h1>
						<h2>I met a <em> dog </em></h2>
						<div class="thedog">
							<img src="img/mdog1.jpg" data-original="img/mdog1.jpg" alt="My Companion" />
							<p>
								Throughout the past years, I got so desperate for someone to have company with. I drowned myself on whiskey, drank till I could not take it any more. I was so ready to die. Then one day, something happened. I stumbled out onto the porch to see if the world was still there. And I discovered a dog! A dog was roving about on my lawn.
							</p>
							<p>
								It was alive! In the daytime! I screamed with joy and started running after the dog. And no wonder, it disappeared. For an hour I wandered around the neighborhood searching vainly, calling out every few moments. In the afternoon I searched again. For two blocks in each direction from my house. I searched each yard, each street, each individual house but found nothing.
							</p>
							<img src="img/mdog2.jpg" data-original="img/mdog2.jpg" alt="Dog in car" />
							<p>
								When I got home, about five, I put out a bowl of milk and a piece of hamburger. Next morning I went outside and found that the milk and hamburger were gone! The dog must have come after dawn, when the streets were safe. It must have evolved a system to have lived so long.
							</p>
							<p>
								The dog must have been very hungry. And that means, if I give food and not chase after him scaring him right away, there is a chance I can win him over. So that's what I did.
							</p>
							<img src="img/mdog3.jpg" data-original="img/mdog3.jpg" alt="Dog sick" />
							<p>
								I gave food every afternoon, as it used to come around 4.  After trying to track where it goes, I found out its survival technique. The dog digs a grave for itself and hide there during nighttime so vampires don't attack it. The dog was infected but was not dead nor a vampires. 
							</p>
							<p>
								On first few days, I tried to hide from him, then gradually I started sitting outside when he eats. But I could not move or make any sound at all. Few weeks go by, and I tried to make the distance a little closer at a time. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Then one day the dog does not come. And it's been two months and I am still in search for him.
